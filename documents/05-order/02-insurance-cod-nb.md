# Insurance, COD & Item Price

How insurance amounts, COD fees, and additional costs are calculated for your shipments

## Insurance Fee Calculation

| Parameter | How It's Determined |
| --- | --- |
| item_value | The declared value of the goods (e.g., 20000) |
| Insurance percentage | Set by the 3PL. See Terms & Conditions |
| insurance_amount | item_value × percentage, rounded up to the nearest 100 |

## COD Fee Calculation

| Parameter | How It's Determined |
| --- | --- |
| item_value | 20000 |
| shipping_cost | 15000 |
| insurance_amount | 500 |
| COD fee percentage | Set by the 3PL. See Terms & Conditions |
| Subtotal | item_value + shipping_cost + insurance_amount = 35500 |
| add_cost | subtotal × cod_fee_percentage, rounded up to the nearest integer |
| cod | subtotal + add_cost |

> For faster pickup requests, shipping cost validation happens during driver validation rather than through the API.

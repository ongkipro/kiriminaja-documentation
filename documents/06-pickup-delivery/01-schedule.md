# Pickup Schedule

We provide two shipping methods, namely pickup and drop-off. If you are interested in using our pickup service, then read this documentation for a good implementation

**Endpoint**: `POST`Information

If your company prefers a fixed daily pickup process, you can set custom pickup hours and skip this endpoint.

You can use your own working-hours pickup schedule, as long as pickup is requested before 16:00 (4:00 PM) local time.
